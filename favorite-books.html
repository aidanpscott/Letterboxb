                <p class="book-review">The book that got me into reading. Tight and accessible prose inside one of the
                    greatest and most influencial sci-series of all-time. A story that shows the struggle for mankind's
                    fight against the overwhelming, genocidal alien alliance known as the Covenant. Read the thrilling
                    prequel to the blockbuster video game series HALO.</p>

                <p class="book-review">The year is 1348. Thomas, a disgraced knight, has found a young girl alone in a
                    dead Norman village. An orphan of the Black Death, and an almost unnerving picture of innocence, she
                    tells Thomas that plague is only part of a larger cataclysm—that the fallen angels under Lucifer are
                    rising in a second war on heaven, and that the world of men has fallen behind the lines of conflict.

                    As hell unleashes its wrath, and as the true nature of the girl is revealed, Thomas will find
                    himself on a macabre battleground of angels and demons, saints, and the risen dead, and in the midst
                    of a desperate struggle for nothing less than the soul of man.</p>

                <p class="book-review">The second book in the legendary Lord of the Rings series, undoubtedly the
                    greatest and most influencial fantasy epic of all time. Frodo and his Companions of the Ring have
                    been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from falling into the hands of
                    the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the wizard, Gandalf, in a
                    battle in the Mines of Moria. And Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize it by
                    force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape, the rest of the company was attacked by Orcs. Now they
                    continue the journey alone down the great River Anduin—alone, that is, save for the mysterious
                    creeping figure that follows wherever they go.</p>

                <p class="book-review">The greatest novel of the illustrous Umberto Eco, perhaps the greatest author of
                    the 20th century. The year is 1327. Franciscans in a wealthy Italian abbey are suspected of heresy,
                    and Brother William of Baskerville arrives to investigate. When his delicate mission is suddenly
                    overshadowed by seven bizarre deaths, Brother William turns to the logic of Aristotle, the theology
                    of Aquinas, and the empirical insights of Roger Bacon to find the killer. He collects evidence,
                    deciphers secret symbols and coded manuscripts, and digs into the eerie labyrinth of the abbey
                    (“where the most interesting things happen at night”) armed with a wry sense of humor and a
                    ferocious curiosity.</p>

                <p class="book-author">By Tanith Lee</p>
                <p class="book-genre">Genre: Dark Fantasy</p>
                <p class="book-review">When the world was flat and the gods had not yet restructured the universe, the
                    cities and hopes of mankind hung upon the whims of the immortal lords of all diabolical powers.

                    For these, such as Azhrarn, Night's Master, and Uhlume, Death's Master, the world was a
                    flesh-and-blood playground for all their strangest desires. But among those demonic lords, the
                    strangest was the master of madness, Chuz.

                    The game that Chuz played with a beautiful woman, with an ambitious king, with an ancient imperial
                    city, was a webwork of good and evil, of hope and horror.

                    But there was always Azhrarn to interfere--to bend delusion to a different outcome--and it was a
                    century-long conflict between two vain immortals with women and men as their terrified pawns.</p>

                <p class="book-genre">Genre: Epic Fantasy</p>
                <p class="book-review">The first book in the most underrated fantasy seres of all time--a series rivaled
                    by none except Tolkein himself. In Selenoth, the race of Man is on the ascendant. The ancient
                    dragons sleep, the evil Witchkings are no more, their evil power destroyed by the courage of Men and
                    the fearsome magic of the Elves. The dwarves have retreated to the kingdoms of the Underdeep, the
                    trolls hide in their mountains, and even the most savage orc tribes have learned to dread the iron
                    discipline of the mighty Amorran legions. But after four hundred years of mutual suspicion, the
                    rivalry between two of the noble Houses Martial that rule the Senate and People threatens to turn
                    violent, even as unrest sparks rebellion throughout the imperial provinces. In the north, the
                    barbarian reavers who have long plagued the coasts of the White Sea sue for peace and beg for royal
                    protection from the King of Savondir, fleeing a mysterious race of ravenous wolf-demons. In the
                    east, there are wars and rumors of war as orcs and goblins gather together in unprecedented numbers,
                    summoned by their dreadful gods.

                    But when the Most Holy and Sanctified Father is found dead in his bed, leaving the Ivory Throne of
                    the Four Apostles unclaimed, the temptation to seize the Sacred College and wield Holy Mother Church
                    as a weapon is more than some fallen souls can resist.</p>

                <p class="book-genre">Genre: Epic Fantasy</p>
                <p class="book-review">Read the beginning to the most influencial fantasy epics of our time. Lord Eddard
                    Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to
                    sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.

                    Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones
                    tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together
                    in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe
                    of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to
                    win back his throne; a child is lost in the twilight between life and death; and a determined woman
                    undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counter-plots,
                    tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs
                    perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of
                    thrones.</p>

                <p class="book-genre">Genre: Gothic Horror</p>
                <p class="book-review">In DRACULA, Bram Stoker created one of the great masterpieces of the horror
                    genre, brilliantly evoking a nightmare world of vampires and vampire hunters and also illuminating
                    the dark corners of Victorian sexuality and desire. When Jonathan Harker visits Transylvania to help
                    Count Dracula with the purchase of a London house, he makes a series of horrific discoveries about
                    his client. Soon afterwards, various bizarre incidents unfold in England: an apparently unmanned
                    ship is wrecked off the coast of Whitby; a young woman discovers strange puncture marks on her neck;
                    and the inmate of a lunatic asylum raves about the 'Master' and his imminent arrival.</p>
